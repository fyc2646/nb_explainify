    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of our analysis is to engage with stock data in a practical way, utilizing Python libraries such as `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. By the end of our exploration, we will have developed the skills to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Historical Stock Data**: We will learn how to access and download historical stock data for any company using its ticker symbol, allowing us to analyze past performance.\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "First, we calculate the simple moving average (SMA) of the stock's closing prices over a specified period, in this case, 20 days. The SMA helps us smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends. This is important because it allows us to see the overall direction of the stock price, making it easier to identify whether the stock is in an upward or downward trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we compute the exponential moving average (EMA), which also considers the closing prices over the same 20-day period but gives more weight to the most recent prices. This means that the EMA reacts more quickly to price changes than the SMA. Understanding the difference between these two averages is crucial because they can provide different signals about potential buying or selling opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at daily returns, which measure how much the stock price changes from one day to the next. This calculation is essential for assessing the stock's volatility and performance on a day-to-day basis. By examining daily returns, we can identify patterns or anomalies that may indicate significant market movements.\n",

    "Finally, we calculate the cumulative return, which shows the total return on an investment over time, taking into account all daily returns. This metric is particularly valuable because it provides a clear picture of how much an investment has grown or shrunk since the"

    "Next, we overlay two important statistical indicators on our price chart: the simple moving average (SMA) and the exponential moving average (EMA). The SMA smooths out price fluctuations by averaging the closing prices over a specific period, while the EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information. These moving averages help us identify potential buy or sell signals. For instance, when the stock price crosses above the SMA or EMA, it might indicate a buying opportunity, whereas crossing below could signal a selling point.\n",
