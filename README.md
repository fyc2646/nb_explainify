# nb-explainify üöÄ

Transform your Jupyter notebooks from plain to extraordinary! nb-explainify is your AI-powered companion that turns basic notebooks into clear documentation that your colleagues will admire and future-you will thank you for.

## Why nb-explainify? ‚ú®

Ever found yourself:
- Staring at notebooks you created months ago, wondering what it does? 
- Rushing to meet deadlines and skipping proper documentation?
- Wanting to share your notebooks but feeling they need more polish?

Say goodbye to these problems! nb-explainify leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT models to automatically:
- Generate crystal-clear explanations that actually make sense
- Optimize your code while preserving its functionality
- Add professional-grade comments that future readers will appreciate
- Create engaging introductions that set the perfect context
- Provide insightful summaries with practical next steps

Think of it as having a professional technical writer, code reviewer, and documentation expert working for you 24/7!

## Features üéØ

- **Smart Markdown Generation**: Get concise, context-aware explanations that focus on what matters. No more generic comments!
- **AI-Powered Code Optimization**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to suggest code improvements for better readability and efficiency. While the optimization is generally reliable, we recommend verifying that the optimized code maintains the original functionality, as LLMs may occasionally generate incorrect suggestions.
- **Professional Documentation**: Add clear, detailed comments that explain not just what the code does, but why it does it. 
- **Engaging Introductions**: Create compelling notebook introductions that perfectly set up your work's context and goals
- **Insightful Summaries**: Generate comprehensive summaries with practical suggestions for future improvements
- **Code Beautification**: Ensure your code follows consistent style guidelines automatically

Best of all? It takes just a few lines of code to transform your notebook from basic to brilliant!

## Example Notebooks üìö

Want to see nb-explainify in action? Check out our example notebooks:
- [`test.ipynb`](test.ipynb): A basic notebook before enhancement
- [`test_explanified.ipynb`](test_explanified.ipynb): The same notebook after running nb-explainify

Compare these notebooks to see how nb-explainify:
- Adds clear, educational explanations
- Enhances code readability
- Creates a comprehensive introduction and summary
- Maintains the original functionality while improving documentation

## Compatibility Note üìù

While nb-explainify works with any Jupyter notebook, it performs best with notebooks that have minimal or no existing comments. For notebooks with existing documentation:
- Existing markdown cells will be enhanced rather than replaced
- New explanations will complement existing documentation
- The tool focuses on filling documentation gaps
- Code optimization and beautification work independently of existing comments

```

## Usage

Basic usage:
```python
from nb_explainify import NotebookProcessor

# Load and process a notebook
processor = NotebookProcessor()
processor.load_notebook("your_notebook.ipynb")
processor.explainify_notebook(output_path="enhanced_notebook.ipynb")
```

Customize processing options:
```python
processor.explainify_notebook(
    output_path="custom_notebook.ipynb",
    to_format=True,      # Format code cells
    to_comment=True,     # Add code comments
    to_optimize=True,    # Optimize code
    to_markdown=True,    # Add markdown explanations
    to_intro=True,       # Add introduction
